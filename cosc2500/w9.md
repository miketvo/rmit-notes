# Q&A for the motorcycle dash

1. Is GPS consider IoT?
Yes according to the most basic definition of IoT, but not quite. It is safest to just find a way to connect directy to the internet.

2. Does the Arduino take data from the Internet or the Internet control the Arduino? Or both?
One or Both are considered okay, as long as the chip communicates with the internet.

3. How exactly does Dat want us to demo our project? Pre-recorded video? Live demo?
Pre-recorded video (optional) and LIVE DEMO (MANDATORY)

# Dat's feedback on the moto dash project idea
Goof, but typical idea
HD if implemented perfectly
DI if implemented 70 - 80%
CR if less
